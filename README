I wrote this for a friend while having trouble sleeping. He's participating in the Cyberpatriot competition.I don't know whether it works or not (as of v0.1). I am writing this readme from the comfort of my floor, of which I'm sprawled upon, on my phone.I am using termux as my terminal emulator and bash or zsh as my shell (too lazy to check, zch is backwards compatible anyways.) I probably will never debug it, as I will probably never use Ubuntu. I have no use for another spyware dumpster fire OS. If you'd like to maintain this or fork it, do as you please.
